My first, utterly useless repository. 

Yup, here it is.  Eric's first repository on Github.  Not much to it.  

Anyways, I'm studying Javascript in order to create unique web presences for artists, designers, architects, and other visually creative professionals. I'm more of an artist and designer myself, but hope to contribute fun, experimental, and visually interesting projects in the future.  

See ya later!
